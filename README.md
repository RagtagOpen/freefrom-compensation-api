# Freefrom Compensation Backend

## Overview
FreeFrom is a nonprofit dedicated to helping survivors of domestic violence achieve financial stability. On their website they have a [compensation tool](https://compensation-quiz.freefrom.org/) where users can answer a series of questions in order to get information about financial resources that are available to them depending on their state.

This repository contains the new Rails backend for the compensation tool and the CMS that allows FreeFrom administrators to change the content in the tool.
