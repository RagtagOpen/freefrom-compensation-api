    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged by someone else’s crime and that person (the defendant) either pleads guilty or is found guilty of that crime in court.
    time: The judge assigned to the criminal case decides whether to award criminal restitution when sentencing the defendant. So, the timing of the criminal restitution decision depends on when the defendant is sentenced.
    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A Prosecutorial District Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing hearing. The more evidence you can give the Prosecutorial District Attorney of your costs, the more likely it will be that you will get compensation.

    attorney: |

      **TIP:** Still have questions? [Here](https://courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/small_claims/sc-guide.pdf)  is a great resource to find out more.
    challenges:
      - "You Will Likely Have to Represent Yourself: You will most likely have to face the person that harmed you in court and will likely have to represent yourself."
      - "Collecting A Judgment Can Be Challenging: If you win a judgment, you will have to collect the money from the person that harmed you which may be challenging. Read more about collecting money in [this resource](https://courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/small_claims/sc-guide.pdf)."
    steps:
      - "**Step 1:** Collect any and all documents and other evidence that support your claims and show the amount of your damages."
      - "**TIP:** Keep all original receipts, bills, statements and other documentation of the costs you’ve had to pay with you in a safe place."
      - "**Step 2:** Locate the District Court division where you plan to file your case. You can find a list of the divisions [here](https://www.courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/district/index.shtml). This is where you will file all your paperwork. It should be filed where the event occurred, where the defendant lives, or where they work."
      - "**Step 3:** Fill out the [Statement of Claim Form](https://www.courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms/pdf_forms/sc/SC-001,%20Statement%20of%20Claim,%20Rev.%2006.14.pdf). You can also get a Statement of Claim Form from the clerk’s office in the District Court. Attach copies of documents that relate to what happened (for example, a police report) and show all your costs (for example, medical bills)."
      - "**TIP:** Make at least 3 copies of all the forms and attachments you fill out so that you will have enough to file with the court, send to the defendant, and keep for your records."
      - "**Step 4:** File the Statement of Claim Form and all attachments with the court and pay the filing fee."
      - "**TIP:** If you can’t afford to pay the fees, you can ask for a waiver by completing and filing [this form](https://www.courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms/pdf_forms/cv/CV-067,%20App%20to%20Proceed%20without%20Fee,%20Rev.%2003_13.pdf)."
      - |
        **Step 5:** The defendant must get a copy of your Statement of Claim form. You can do this in any of the following ways:

        * Clerk’s Office Service: You can have the clerk’s office send the Statement of Claim to the defendant. You will have to fill out a [form](https://www.courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms/pdf_forms/sc/SC-006,%20Aff%20&%20Req%20for%20Service,%20Rev.%2006.14.pdf) and pay a fee.

        * First-Class Mail, Postage Prepaid: You can send a copy of the Statement of Claim and any attachments along with 2 [Notice of Service forms](https://www.courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms/pdf_forms/sc/SC-005,%20Notice%20of%20Service,%20Rev.%2006.14.pdf) in an envelope along with a stamped, self-addressed envelope that the defendant can use to send the signed Notice of Service forms back to you.

        * **TIP:** Do not use the First-Class Mail option if you do not want the defendant to know your address.

        * Restricted Delivery, Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested: Buy and fill out a green certified mail card from the U.S. Post Office and attach it to your first-class, postage-paid envelope. The defendant must sign for the envelope at the post office and the post office will send you the green card. If, after about 3 weeks, the defendant has not signed, the post office will tell you that service has failed. If that happens, you will have to arrange for the sheriff’s office to serve the Statement of Claim.

        * By the Sheriff’s Office: The Sheriff in the county where the defendant lives can deliver the documents for you. Make sure that the second page of the Statement of Claim form is included because this is what the sheriff fills out when service is made. You will have to pay a fee.
      - "**Step 6:** You will receive proof of service once the defendant gets your documents. File that proof of service and the original Statement of Claim with the clerk of the District Court within 20 days."
      - "**Step 7:** You will get a notice from the court with a hearing date. Do not miss this court date."
      - "**Step 8:** Prepare for your appearance in court by thinking through what you want to tell the judge, what evidence you want to present, and whether or not you want to bring witnesses."
      - "**Step 9:** Attend your court date. Bring your evidence and witnesses with you."
      - "**TIP:** If you and the defendant attend the hearing, the judge may ask if you are willing to speak with a mediator or with one another directly to resolve the issues without a hearing. You have the right to refuse."
      - "**Step 10:** Present your case, closely following any directions given by the judge."
      - "**Step 11:** If the defendant does not appear, the judge will give you a default judgment. Find more information about default judgments and the Small Claims Court process in general, [here](https://courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/small_claims/sc-guide.pdf)."
      - "**Step 12:** If you win your case, you can request a disclosure hearing where the defendant has to tell the judge about their income, earnings, and assets that can be used to pay the judgment. Read more about this process [here](https://courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/small_claims/sc-guide.pdf). A Request for Disclosure Hearing form can be found [here](https://www.courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms/pdf_forms/sc/sc003-request-for-disclosure-hearing.pdf)."
    what_if_i_disagree:
      - "**TIP:** Read the judge’s decision carefully and look for instructions on how to appeal. Follow those instructions carefully."
      - "**Step 1:** Generally, you must file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the Superior Court within **30 days** after the date of the judgment and pay the filing fee."
      - "**TIP:** Appealing a small claims judgment is more complicated than bringing a small claims case, so you will probably need to hire a lawyer. [Here](http://www.mainebar.org/page/AttorneyRequest) is a resource for finding a lawyer."

    who: You can file a civil tort claim against the person that harmed you if the law recognizes a cause of action that fits the facts of your case.
    when: Generally, a claim must be filed within 1-2 years of the actions that caused you injury. The exact deadline depends on the type of claim you bring.
    time: The whole process will most likely take over a year.
    cost: Hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
    likelihood: Your likelihood of success depends on several factors, including the evidence you are able to present, the judge or jury assigned to your case, and the attorney that represents you.

      - "**Step 2:** If you are unable to find an attorney on your own, we have included some helpful links in the “Resources” section."

        * Date of the incident(s)

        * Brief description of the incident(s)
