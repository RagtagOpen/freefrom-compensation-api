    cost: |
      You must pay a fee of $10 to file a small claims case. Other fees may apply to deliver your documents to the defendant.

It’s a good idea to attach proof of your income to the Affidavit (bank statements, pay stubs, EBT cards, disability check, etc.).
    covered_expenses: The total amount you are seeking must be $6,000.00 or less. You cannot bring claims for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, slander or libel in small claims court.

    safety: You will most likely have to face the person who harmed you in court. A bailiff should be present in court if you feel unsafe. You can also bring a friend or family member with you for support.
    story: You will have to tell the judge specific details about what happened to you, including how you were injured and how much those injuries cost you.
    attorney: You can be represented by an attorney if you wish, but it’s important to keep in mind that the attorney may cost more than the amount of money you receive from court.
    challenges:
      - "**You Will Likely Have to Represent Yourself:** You will most likely have to face the person that harmed you in court and represent yourself."
      - "**Collecting A Judgment Can Be Challenging:** If you win a judgment, you will have to collect the money from the person who harmed you, which may be challenging. Read more about collecting money [here](https://smallclaims.uslegal.com/small-claims-laws-by-state/wyoming-small-claims-law/)."
    steps:
      - "**Step 1:** Before you file, you must send a letter to the person you are suing to demand that they pay you."
      - "**TIP:** For safety reasons, it’s a good idea not to include your address in your written demand letter to the person who harmed you."
      - "**Step 2:** Collect any and all documents and other evidence that support your claims and show the amount of your damages."
      - "**TIP:** Keep all original receipts, bills, statements, and other documentation of the costs you’ve had to pay with you in a safe place. "
      - "**Step 3:** Locate the proper circuit court [here](https://www.courts.state.wy.us/circuit-courts/circuit-court-locations/). You will generally be required to file in the county in which the person who harmed you has an address. The relevant circuit court is where you will file all your paperwork."
      - "**Step 4:** After carefully reading the instructions, complete a [Civil Cover Sheet](http://www.courts.state.wy.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WRCP31Final_CivilCoverSheet-20150708.pdf), [Small Claims Affidavit](http://www.courts.state.wy.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Claims-Affidavit-2016.pdf), and [Summons](http://www.courts.state.wy.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Small_Claims_Summons_Return.pdf). You can also request the forms from the clerk of the circuit court."
      - "**Step 5:** Attach copies of documents that relate to what happened (for example, a police report) and show all your costs (for example, medical bills). "
      - "**TIP:** Make at least three copies of all forms and attachments you fill out so that you have enough copies to file with the court, send to the defendant, and keep for your records. "
      - "**Step 6:** Sign the completed documents and attachments, file them with the clerk of the circuit court, and pay the filing fees. "
      - "**TIP:** If you cannot afford to pay the fees, you can apply for a waiver by completing and filing this [Affidavit of Indigency and Request for Waiver](https://www.courts.state.wy.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MISCGA-8.-Affidavit-of-Indigency.pdf). It’s a good idea to attach proof of your income to the Affidavit (bank statements, pay stubs, EBT cards, disability check, etc.). "
      - "**Step 7:** The person you are suing must get a copy of the documents you’ve filed. You can ask the clerk or sheriff’s department to send the notice, or you can hire a process server to deliver it; you cannot deliver it yourself. All three options require a fee, but if you filled out a fee waiver and it was accepted, then you probably won’t need to pay anything. You can ask the clerk of the circuit court for guidance. "
      - "**Step 8:** You will receive proof that the person you are suing received your documents. File that proof with the clerk of the circuit court. "
      - "**Step 9:** The court will set a trial date for your case. Do not miss your trial date. "
      - "**Step 10:** Prepare for your appearance in court by thinking about what you want to tell the judge, what evidence you want to present, and whether or not you want to bring witnesses."
      - "**Step 11:** Attend your court date. Bring your evidence and witnesses with you. "
      - "**Step 12:** Present your case, closely following any instructions given by the judge. "
      - "**Step 13:** Receive the judge’s order either at the end of the hearing or at a later date via mail. "
      - "**Step 14:** If you win your case, you will need to take steps to collect that compensation. Read more about collecting a small claims judgment [here](https://smallclaims.uslegal.com/small-claims-laws-by-state/wyoming-small-claims-law/)."
    what_if_i_disagree:
      - "**TIP:** Read the judge’s decision carefully and look for any instructions about how to appeal. Follow those instructions carefully."
      - "Generally, you must file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court within 20 days after the judge makes their decision. "
      - "You must pay a bond and a circuit court filing fee. "
      - "The file will then be transferred to the Circuit Clerk, and you will then have to file a “petition” for appeal with the Circuit Clerk’s office. "
