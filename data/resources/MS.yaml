    attorney: You can be represented by an attorney if you wish. But, it’s important to keep in mind that the attorney may cost more than the amount of money you receive from court.

      - "**Collecting A Judgment Can Be Challenging:** If you win a judgment, you will have to collect the money from the person that harmed you which may be challenging.

You can ask the clerk or the sheriff’s department to send the notice, or you can hire a process server to deliver it – you cannot deliver it yourself.
