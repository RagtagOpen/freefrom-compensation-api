    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged as the result of someone else’s crime and that person (the defendant) either pleads guilty or is found guilty of that crime in court.
    time: The judge assigned to the criminal case decides whether to award criminal restitution when sentencing the defendant. So, the timing of the criminal restitution decision depends on when the defendant is sentenced.
    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A District Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing hearing. The more evidence you can give the District Attorney of your costs, the more likely you are to get compensation.
