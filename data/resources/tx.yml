    1. **Level 1 - Reconsideration Review:** Within **30 days** of the decision, you must send a signed letter explaining why you disagree with the decision and any additional documents or evidence supporting your application. CVC staff will review your application and any new evidence and will decide whether to approve or deny your application. If you still disagree with the decision, you can move to the next level of review.
    2. **Level 2 - Final Ruling Hearing:** Within **30 days** of the reconsideration decision, you must send a signed letter asking for a hearing. CVC will schedule a telephone hearing and send you a notice of when it will take place. During the hearing, you can tell the hearing officer why you think your application should be approved. The hearing officer will send you their hearing in the mail. If you still disagree with the decision, you can move to the final level of review.
    3. **Level 3 - Judicial Review:** You must submit a signed “written notice of dissatisfaction” with the Office of the Attorney General within 40 days of the prior decision. You must then file a lawsuit in the District Court within **40 days** after you submit the written notice.

    TIP: An appeal to District Court will be complex and follow complicated procedures. It’s a good idea to try and find a lawyer to help you through the process.
