  - resource_category: Criminal Restitution
    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged as the result of someone else’s crime, and the person who committed the crime (the defendant) either pleads guilty or is found guilty of a crime in court.
    time: The judge assigned to the criminal case decides whether to award criminal restitution when sentencing the defendant. So the timing of the criminal restitution decision depends on when the defendant is sentenced.
    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A State’s Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing hearing. The more evidence you can give the State's Attorney of your costs, the more likely it will be that you will get compensation.

      **TIP:** If you can’t afford to pay the fees, you can ask the court for a waiver by completing and filing [this form](https://courts.illinois.gov/Forms/approved/procedures/FeeWaiver_Civil_Application.pdf).
