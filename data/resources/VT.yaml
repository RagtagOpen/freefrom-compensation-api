  - resource_category: Criminal Restitution
    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged by someone else’s crime and that person (the defendant) either pleads guilty to the crime or is found guilty of the crime in court.
    time: The judge assigned to the criminal case decides whether to award criminal restitution when sentencing the defendant. So the timing of the criminal restitution decision depends on when the defendant is sentenced.
    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A State’s Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing hearing and a later restitution hearing. The more evidence you can give the State's Attorney of your costs, the more likely you are to get compensation.

To do that, you must [register your email addresses online](https://efiling.eservices.crt.state.vt.us/). You will get an email with your electronic registration number (ERN). If you list your ERN in the blank on the complaint form, you don’t have to file a stamped self-addressed envelope because the court will send you all documents by email."

The clerk will decide if you qualify for the fee waiver based on the Federal Poverty Guidelines."
      - "**Step 8:** Once the sheriff delivers the documents to the defendant, they will send you a Return of Service. You must file this with the court within 60 days."
      - "**Step 9:** After the defendant files an answer, the court will schedule a hearing and mail you notice of when and where it will happen. Don’t miss this date."
      - "**Step 10:** Prepare for your appearance in court by thinking through what you want to tell the judge, what evidence you want to present, and whether or not you want to bring witnesses."
