    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged by someone else’s crime and that person (the defendant) either pleads guilty or is found guilty of that crime in court.

    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A Prosecuting Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing and / or restitution hearing.
