  - resource_category: Criminal Restitution
    who: You are eligible for criminal restitution if you were injured, lost money, or had property damaged by someone else’s crime and that person (the defendant) either pleads guilty or is found guilty of that crime in court.
    time: The judge assigned to the criminal case decides whether to award criminal restitution when sentencing the defendant or within 90 days afterward. So the timing of the criminal restitution decision depends on when the defendant is sentenced.
    cost: It is free of charge.
    likelihood: A District Attorney will be assigned to the criminal case on behalf of the state. They will ask the judge to grant you criminal restitution at the defendant’s sentencing hearing. The more evidence you can give the District Attorney of your costs, the more likely you are to get compensation.

    attorney: Attorneys are not allowed in Oregon small claims courts. You must represent yourself.

      - "**Step 3:** You must complete and file a form called a complaint. You can file the complaint [online](https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/online/Pages/iforms.aspx) or submit a [paper](https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/Documents/SC-ClmNotice.pdf) complaint. You can also request the proper forms from the clerk of the circuit or justice court."

You can ask the clerk or sheriff’s department to send the notice, or you can hire a process server to deliver it – you cannot deliver it yourself. All three options require a fee but if you filled out a fee waiver and it was accepted then you likely won’t need to pay anything."
      - "**Step 7:** You will receive proof that the defendant received your documents. File that proof with the clerk of the justice court."
      - "**Step 8:** The court will set a trial date for your case. Do not miss your trial date."
      - "**Step 9:** Prepare for your appearance in court by thinking about what you want to tell the judge, what evidence you want to present, and whether or not you want to bring witnesses."
      - "**Step 10:** Attend your court date. Bring your evidence and witnesses with you."

      - "**TIP:** Read the judge’s decision carefully and look for instructions on how to appeal. Follow those instructions carefully."
      - If your case was heard in a circuit court, the judge's decision is final. There is no appeal.
      - If your case was heard in a justice court and you lose your claim, you cannot appeal. But, if the defendant brings a claim against you in the same case and wins, you may appeal to a circuit court. You must file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court within **10 days** after the justice makes their decision. The decision of the circuit court on appeal from a justice court is final.

    time: The whole process will most likely take over a year.
